## Description

Where 2 Eat @ is a self-directed project created for a job application as a Web Developer at Devlift Media. This app is an address book that stores one's favourite places to eat. The user inputs the restaurant's name, address, and a recommended dish which is submitted in a form. The data is then saved to a real-time database in Firebase. This database is used to display the entries in the form of a card that is placed in a category where the first letter of the restaurant name corresponds to the letter of the category.
